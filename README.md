# BarcodeScanner
My very first venture into app development using Java and Android Studio! With this app, I've created a simple barcode scanner app that makes checking food items for dietary restrictions a breeze.

Imagine this: you're at the grocery store, wondering if a snack is suitable for your specific dietary needs. With this app you can simply scan the barcode, and the app instantly tells you if it's a good fit for you.

It's easy to customize your dietary profile. Just select your restrictions, whether it's gluten-free, lactose-free, vegetarian, vegan, or any other category you follow. Then, scan away! The app will analyze the product and provide you with quick, clear information about its compatibility with your diet.


Huge shoutout to Ira Pramanick, my amazing mentor, for helping me tremendously with this project :)
