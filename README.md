# BarcodeScanner
My very first venture into app development using Java and Android Studio! With this app, I've created a simple barcode scanner app that makes checking food items for dietary restrictions a breeze.

It's easy to customize your dietary profile. Just select your restrictions, whether it's gluten-free, lactose-free, vegetarian, vegan, or any other category you follow. Then, scan away! The app instantly tells you if the selected food item is a good fit for you.

Huge shoutout to Ira Pramanick, my amazing mentor, for helping me with this project :)
